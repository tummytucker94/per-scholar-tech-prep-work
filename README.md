# per-scholar-tech-prep-work

A front-end project containing the tech prep work for Per Scholas — resources and materials designed to help learners prepare ahead of bootcamp-style training tracks.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Many Per Scholas training tracks require learners to complete self-study “Tech Prep Work” (often from free online courses or platform lessons) prior to the start of the official program. This repository provides a clean, web-based collection of those materials—organized using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—so learners can review everything in one place.

This repo acts as:

* A **personal learning hub** for structured prep work
* A **reference library** for foundational tech skills
* A **portfolio artifact** demonstrating early front-end and documentation work
